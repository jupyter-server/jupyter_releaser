# Contributing to Jupyter Releaser

## General Jupyter contributor guidelines

If you're reading this section, you're probably interested in contributing to
Jupyter. Welcome and thanks for your interest in contributing!

Please take a look at the Contributor documentation, familiarize yourself with
using the Jupyter Server, and introduce yourself on the mailing list and
share what area of the project you are interested in working on.

For general documentation about contributing to Jupyter projects, see the
[Project Jupyter Contributor Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html)

## Setting Up a Development Environment

Use the following steps:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_releaser
cd jupyter-releaser
pip install -e .[test]
```

If you are using a system-wide Python installation and you only want to install the package for you,
you can add `--user` to the install commands.

Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting, etc.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

You can also invoke the pre-commit hook manually at any time with

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

Once you have done this, you can launch the main branch of Jupyter Releaser
from any directory in your system with::

```bash
jupyter-releaser --help
```

## Running Tests

To run the Python tests, use:

```bash
pytest
```
