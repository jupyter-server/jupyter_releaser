# Making Your First Release

This guide covers creating your first release on a repository that
already uses Jupyter Releaser.

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the target repository
- Publish access to PYPI and/or npm assets associated with the repo

## Set up

- Fork `jupyter_releaser`
- Generate a [GitHub Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with access to target GitHub repo to run GitHub Actions
- Add the token as `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` in the [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) of your fork. The token must have `repo` and `workflow` scopes.
- If the repo generates PyPI release(s), create a scoped PyPI [token](https://packaging.python.org/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#saving-credentials-on-github). We recommend using a scoped token for security reasons.
- You can store the token as `PYPI_TOKEN` in your fork's `Secrets`.

  - Advanced usage: if you are releasing multiple repos, you can create a secret named `PYPI_TOKEN_MAP` instead of `PYPI_TOKEN` that is formatted as follows:

    ```text
    owner1/repo1,token1
    owner2/repo2,token2
    ```

    If you have multiple Python packages in the same repository, you can point to them as follows:

    ```text
    owner1/repo1/path/to/package1,token1
    owner1/repo1/path/to/package2,token2
    ```

- If the repo generates npm release(s), add access token for [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens), saved as `NPM_TOKEN` in "Secrets".

## Draft Changelog

- Go to the "Actions" tab in your fork of `jupyter_releaser`
- Select the "Draft Changelog" workflow on the left
- Click on the "Run workflow" dropdown button on the right
- Fill in the appropriate parameters

  - The "New Version Spec" will usually be the full version (e.g. 0.7.1). Repos using `tbump` can also use the "next" or "patch"
    option, which will bump the micro version (or the build version in the case of a prerelease). The "minor" option allows projects using "tbump" to bump
    to the next minor version directly. Note: The "next" and "patch" options
    are not available when using dev versions, you must use explicit versions
    instead.
  - Use the "since" field to select PRs prior to the latest tag to include in the release
  - Type "true" in the "since the last stable git tag" if you would like to include PRs since the last non-prerelease version tagged on the target repository and branch.
  - The workflow will use the GitHub API to find the relevant pull requests and make an appropriate changelog entry.
  - The workflow will create a pull request to the target
    repository and branch. It will print the link in the "\*\* Next Step \*\*" job step.

## Review Changelog PR

- Go to the pull request created by the "Draft Changelog" workflow

  ![Draft Changelog Workflow Pull Request](../images/draft_changelog_pr.png)

- Review the contents, fixing typos or otherwise editing as necessary.
- If there is a section called "Other Merged PRs", it means those PRs did not have one of the appropriate labels. If desired, you can go label those PRs and then re-run the workflow, or move the entries manually to the desired section. The appropriate labels are: bug, maintenance, enhancement, feature, and documentation.
- The PR will lay out which steps you should take next based on how the "Draft Changelog" workflow was run.
- Merge the PR
- Delete the temporary branch

## Full Release

- Return to your fork of `jupyter_releaser`
- Click on the "Actions" tab
- Select the "Full Release" workflow on the left
- Click on the "Run workflow" button on the right
- Fill in the entries as prompted by the automated changelog text

  ![Full Release Workflow Dialog](../images/draft_release.png)

  - The additional "Post Version Spec" field should be used if your repo uses a dev version (e.g. 0.7.0.dev0)

- The workflow will draft a GitHub release, publish assets to the appropriate registries.
- If the workflow is not targeting the default branch, it will also generate a forward-port pull request for the changelog entry to the default branch.
- When the workflow finishes it will print a link to the GitHub release and the forward-port PR (if appropriate) in the "\*\* Next Step \*\*" output.

- **Note** If the publish portion fails you can attempt to publish the draft GitHub release given by the URL in the "\*\* Failure Message \*\*" using the "Publish Release" workflow.
- **Note** GitHub Actions caches the secrets used on a given workflow run. So if you run into an auth issue, you'll
  need to run a new workflow instead of re-running the existing workflow.
- Review and merge the forward-port PR if applicable
- Announce the release on appropriate channels
